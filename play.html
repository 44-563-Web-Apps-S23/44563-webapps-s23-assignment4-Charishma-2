        <h4>Name of the Play : WHITE DRESSES</h4>
        <h4>Author : _Paul Greene_ </h4>
        <p>In addition to _White Dresses_, Mr. Greene has written a number of
            one-act plays: _The Last of the Lowries_ (to be included in a
            forthcoming volume of Carolina Folk-Plays, published by Henry Holt &
            Company), _The Miser_, _The Old Man of Edenton_, _The Lord's Will_,
            _Wreck P'int_, _Granny Boling_ (in _The Drama_ for August-September,
            1921). The first three plays named above were produced originally by the
            Carolina Playmakers at Chapel Hill.

            Out of the many conflicts of American life, past and present, Mr. Greene
            sees possibilities for a great native drama. _White Dresses_ presents a
            fundamental aspect of the race problem in America.</p>
