        <h4>Name of the Play : WHITE DRESSES</h4>
        <h4>Author : _Paul Greene_ </h4>
        <p>In addition to _White Dresses_, Mr. Greene has written a number of
            one-act plays: _The Last of the Lowries_ (to be included in a
            forthcoming volume of Carolina Folk-Plays, published by Henry Holt &
            Company), _The Miser_, _The Old Man of Edenton_, _The Lord's Will_,
            _Wreck P'int_, _Granny Boling_ (in _The Drama_ for August-September,
            1921). The first three plays named above were produced originally by the
            Carolina Playmakers at Chapel Hill.

            Out of the many conflicts of American life, past and present, Mr. Greene
            sees possibilities for a great native drama. _White Dresses_ presents a
            fundamental aspect of the race problem in America.</p>

            from his breast-pocket, wipes his forehead, and then flips the dust from

                 her feet from the floor, punctuating her movements by tapping with
                 her stick._ MORGAN _sees_ MARY _looking at the package_.</p>
        <h5><div class = "MORGAN">MORGAN</div></h5>
        <p>That's for Mary. I was comin' down this way an' caught up with
            John. He said he was comin' here to bring it. An' so I took an' brought
            it, though he acted sort of queer about it, like he didn't want me even
            to save him a long walk. Wonder what that nigger can be givin' you.
            [MARY _starts toward the bed_.] No, you ain't goin' to see it now, gal.
            We got a little business to 'tend to first. Did you tell Candace what I
            said?
